DIY was delayed today by a rather prolonged shopping trip that involved buying a carpet, 
Subway meatballs and watching puppy grooming in a Pets at Home. We arrived home at 4pm with
bags full of sockets, a pad saw and a galvanised steel band. All ready to start operation hide cable behind wall.

The grey and cables were attached to the wall in trunking. We wanted to put them inside the wall.

We made some holes and started threading the cable through. This quickly become something of a pain. 
Then we hit the corner, which upgraded the pain to an agony. The number of holes quickly increased. 
Somehow depite losing the cable in the wall a couple of times we actually got it through.

We attached the cables to the wall using a [Galvanised Band](http://www.screwfix.com/p/galvanised-band-12mm-x-10m/18298) 
(Thanks to my pal Tom for explaining this). So a fair bit of drilling and it was all in place.

Tensely I switched to the power on at the mains again and - Joy - the light lit up.

So - yay that worked, sadly we planned to do this twice today but ran out of time so we'll have to do this all again tomorrow.

We also made a key decision on the colour we're going to paint the room. Donna chose a bluey-green Dulux called Mint Macaroon.

We're going with the one on the right.

**Plan for tomorrow is:**

* Fit and hide a cable for a heater
* Get a base coat on the ceiling
